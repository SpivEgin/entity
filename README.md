# Entity


A simple ORM for Relational and NoSQL database.

* The support of database is done by use of plugins.
    * Current plugins include [Couchbase](https://github.com/rikulo/couchclient) and [PostgreSQL](https://github.com/xxgreg/postgresql).
* Entity can run at both client and server.
* To minimize the size of the generated JavaScript code, Entity doesn't use mirrors or annotations.
